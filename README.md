## PLUE-SLAM: An RGB-D SLAM System Integrating Uncertainty Estimation of Point and Line Features
## 1. Introduction
<div style="text-align: justify;">
The code for the uncertainty estimation module in PLUE-SLAM, a point–line RGB-D SLAM method built on the ORB-SLAM2 framework.


Currently, the uncertainty-related code in the front-end tracking is already available, including the initialization, feature and pose uncertainty estimation during tracking, and the uncertainty initialization for newly created features with CI-filter fusion in the tracking. We will open-source the remaining code after the paper is accepted.


To facilitate the integration of uncertainty into individual SLAM systems, this project has open-sourced the modules related to the calculation of feature and pose uncertainties. Users can incorporate these modules into their own SLAM systems for use. For example, this code can be integrated into [ORB-SLAM2](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2) and also needs to implement the line feature association and optimization. You can refer to [PL-VINS](https://github.com/cnqiangfu/PL-VINS) implementation and the [G2O documentation](https://github.com/RainerKuemmerle/g2o).
